Sure, I'd be happy to explain the difference between LAYOUT_FILL and LAYOUT_FIX in more detail.

LAYOUT_FILL is a layout constraint that tells the child widget to fill the available space
in the parent widget. This means that the child widget will expand or shrink to fill the
parent widget as necessary, while maintaining its aspect ratio. This is useful when you
want a child widget to resize dynamically based on the size of the parent widget.

On the other hand, LAYOUT_FIX is a layout constraint that tells the child widget to
 have a fixed size. This means that the child widget will maintain the same size regardless
  of the size of the parent widget. This is useful when you want a child widget to have a
  specific size, and you don't want it to change when the size of the parent widget changes.

When you use LAYOUT_FILL without any additional constraints, the child widget will fill
the available space in the parent widget, but the parent widget will not expand to fill t
he available space in its container. This can cause the child widget to appear smaller than expected.

To solve this problem, you can set a fixed size for the parent widget using LAYOUT_FIX.
This ensures that the parent widget will always have the same size, and the child widget
will fill the available space within the parent widget.

In summary, LAYOUT_FILL tells the child widget to fill the available space in the parent widget,
 while LAYOUT_FIX tells the child widget to have a fixed size. To ensure that the child widget
 fills the available space in the parent widget, you may need to use LAYOUT_FILL in conjunction
 with a fixed size for the parent widget using LAYOUT_FIX.
