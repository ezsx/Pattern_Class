# Here is an example implementation of the Singleton pattern for a DB class in Ruby:

require 'pg'

class DataBase
  @@instance = nil

  def self.instance
    if @@instance == nil
      @@instance = DB.new
    end

    return @@instance
  end

  private_class_method :new

  def initialize
    @conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'my_db', user: 'my_user', password: 'my_password', host: 'localhost')
  end

  def execute(query)
    @conn.exec(query)
  end
end

# In this implementation, the DB class has a class variable @@instance
# that stores the singleton instance of the class.
# The instance method is defined as a class method and returns the singleton instance.
# If the singleton instance does not exist, it is created by calling the private constructor method new.

# With this implementation, we can ensure that only one instance of the database connection
# is created and used throughout the application.
